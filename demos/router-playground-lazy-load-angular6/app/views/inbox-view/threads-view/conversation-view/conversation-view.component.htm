	We are somewhat HACKING the idea of a routable component here. Because we need to
	render the subview based on the PARENT ROUTE, we can't rely on the router-outlet.
	Instead, we have to explicitly render these components AS IF THEY WERE ROUTABLE 
	views. That said, these components will believe they are routable internally and
	will use the ActivatedRoute injectable to gather data.
