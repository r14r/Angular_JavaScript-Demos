		Bluebird Promise Implementation

	<p>
		<em>Look at console &mdash; things being logged, yo!</em>
	</p>

	<!--
		CAUTION: We have to include the CORE shim BEFOE we include BLUEBIRD. If we
		include Bluebird first, the Core shim will overwrite the Promise reference.
	-->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="../../vendor/core-js/2.4.1/shim.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="../../vendor/bluebird/3.5.0/bluebird.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">

		// Don't have Bluebird overwrite the global Promise reference. If we want to use
		// the Bluebird promises, we want to make that an explicit choice in the code.
		var Bluebird = Promise.noConflict();


		// Listen for unhandled Promise rejections.
		// --
		// NOTE: At the time of this writing, only Chrome has native support for this 
		// global event. Other browser may or may not log the root Error to the console,
		// but the behavior differs depending on the Promise implementation (ie, native
		// vs. shim).
		window.addEventListener(
			"unhandledrejection",
			function handleRejection( event ) {

				// Prevent the default behavior, which is logging the unhandled rejection
				// error to the console.
				// --
				// NOTE: This is only meaningful in Chrome that supports this event.
				event.preventDefault();

				// The native event-handler in Chrome puts the Reason and Promise in the
				// root event, but Bluebird attaches them to the event detail.
				var reason = ( event.reason || event.detail.reason );
				var promise = ( event.promise || event.detail.promise );

				console.group( "UNHANDLED PROMISE REJECTION" );
				console.log( reason );
				console.log( promise );
				console.groupEnd();

			}
		);


		// Now that we have our global event-handler in place, let's create a Promise
		// chain that results in a Rejection for which we provide no .catch() handler.
		var promise = Promise
			.resolve( "Hello" )
			.then(
				function() {

					throw( new Error( "Something went wrong!" ) );

				}
			)
		;


		// Just including the Bluebird library doesn't do anything (since we called 
		// .noConflict() in order to ensure Bluebird was not the global Promise 
		// implementation); we therefore have to wrap the native Promise object in a
		// Bluebird promise in order to ensure that the down-chain functionality is 
		// provided by Bluebird. This will leave us with a Bluebird promise that is
		// rejected with no .catch() handler ... which will cause Bluebird to trigger
		// the global "unhandledrejection" event.
		// --
		// NOTE: If we didn't call Promise.noConflict(), we wouldn't need this step.
		Bluebird.resolve( promise );
